The wavelet tree, invented by Grossi, Gupta, and Vitter[1], is an important data structure with a vast number of applications to stringology, computational geometry, and others[2].

There are optimised search methods using the suffix array combined with auxiliary data structures, such as the LCP (longest-common prefix) array, or wavelet trees. See for details [3].
